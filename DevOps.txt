######
MAVEN#
######
-> java is a programming language
-> java language developed by sun microsoft company
-> oracle company acquired sun microsystem
-> java is under license of oracle company
-> java is a high level programming language
-> java is simple programming language
-> java program files will have .java as extension
	ex: demo.java, hello.java, driver.java, calculator.java etc..
-> we can't execute .java files directly
-> java programs should be converted into machine understandable format to execute
-> java programs (.java file) contains source code
-> we need to compile java source code into byte code using java compiler (javac)
	ex: javac demo.java
-> when we compile java code it will create .class file
-> we need to execute .class file to run the java program
	ex: java Demo
-> when we run java program using java command, JVM will start and it will execute java program
	note: JVM stands for java vitual machine
-> jvm will convert byte code into machine understandable code
-> java project contains several java programs (.java files)
-> we need to compile project source code into byte code
-> when we compile project source code we will get .class files
-> to deploy java project, we will package all .class files as JAR or WAR file
	JAR : Java Archieve
	WAR : Web Archieve
-> standalone java projects will be packaged as JAR file
-> web applications will be packaged as WAR file

Maven
+++++
-> maven is a free source and open source software given by Apache Organization
-> maven s/w is developed using Java programming language
-> maven is used to perform build automation for java projects
-> maven is called as java build tool

what we can do using maven
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) we can create initial project folder structure using maven
2) we can download "project dependencies" using maven
	(ex : springboot, hibernate, kafka, redis, email, log4j, junit, security...)
-> to develop one java project we will user several frameworks like spring, hibernate etc along with java
-> we need to download those frameworks and we should add to our java project
-> these frameworks we are using in our prject are called as our project dependencies
-> instead of we are downloading dependencies, we can tell to maven s/w to download dependencies
note: required dependencies we will add in "pom.xml" file then maven s/w will download them
-> pom stands for project object model
-> when we create maven project then pom.xml file will be created automatically
-> pom.xml will act as input file for maven software
3) we can compile project source code using maven
4) we can package java project as jar or war file using maven

Maven Installation
++++++++++++++++++
1) download and install java software
-> when we install java we will get below 2 things
	a) JDK (java development kit)
	b) JRE (java runtime environment)
-> JDK contains set of tools to develop java program
-> JRE contains platform /environment which is used to run java programs
Link to downalod java: https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html
2) set JAVA_HOME in environment variables (system env variables)
	user environment variables: specific to particular account which logged in our pc
	system environment variables : for all accounts
note: environment variables will be used by operating system
	JAVA_HOME = c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202
3) set path for JAVA (Go to system env variables -> env variables -> system variables -> selct path and click on edit then add JDK path)
	Path = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202\bin
4) verify java installation by executing below command in "command prompt"
	> java -version
note: it should display java version which we have installed
5) download maven software from apache website
	Link to download Maven : https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
	File Name: apache-maven-3.8.5-bin.zip (Binary Archive)
6) Extract Maven Zip file -> copy extracted maven folder and paste it in "C" drive
7) set MAVEN_HOME in System Environment variables
	MAVEN_HOME = C:\apache-maven-3.8.5
8) Set Path for Maven in System Environment Variables
	Path : C:\apache-maven-3.8.5\bin
9) Open command prompt and verify maven nstallation using below command
	> mvn -version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maven Terminology
+++++++++++++++++
archetype
groupId
artifactID
packaging

-> Archetype represents what type of project we want to create
	-> maven-archetype-quickstart : It represents java standalone application
	-> maven-archetype-webapp : It represents java web application
Note: Maven providing 1500++ archetypes
-> groupID represents company name or project name
-> artifactID represents project name or project module name
-> packaging represents how we want to package our java application (jar or war)

Creating standalone application using maven
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) create one folder for maven practice
2) open command prompt from that folder
3) execute below command to create maven project

>> mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DgroupId=in.ashokit -DartifactId=01-maven-app -DinteractiveMode=false

>> mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DgroupId=in.ashokit -DartifactId=01-maven-web-app -DinteractiveMode=false

4) once project created verify project folder structure
	01-Maven-App
		   - src
                       - main 
                               - java
                       - test 
                               - java
                - pom.xml
       src/main/java : Application source code (.java files)
       src/test/java : Application unit test code (.java files)
       pom.xml : project object model (maven configuration file)
5) we can add dependencies in pom.xml file
6) we can find maven dependencies in www.mvnrepository.com website
7) add below dependency in pom.xml file

<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
	<version>5.2.22.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>

How maven will download dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> maven will download dependencies using repository
-> in maven we have 3 types of repositories
	1) central repository
	2) remote repository
	3) local repository
-> central repository is maintained by apache organization
-> every company will maintain their own remote repository
-> local repository will be created in our system (location : c://users/<uname>/.m2)

-> when we add dependency in pom.xml, maven will search for that dependency in local repository. if it is available it will add to project build path.
-> if dependency not available in local repository then maven will connect to central repository or remote repository based on our configuration.

note: by default maven will connect with central repository. if we want to use remote repository then we need to configure remote repository details.

note: every software company will maintain their own remote repository (ex: jfrog)

Configuring remote repository
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>id</id>
		<url>jfrog-repo-url</url>
</repositories>

Maven Goals
+++++++++++
-> to perform project build activities maven provided several goals for us

clean 
compile
test
package
install

-> clean goal is used to delete target folder
-> compile goal is used to compile source code. compiled code will be stored in target folder
						compile
                     .java -----------> .class
-> test goal is used to execute unit test code of our application (junit code)
-> package goal is used to generate jar or war file for our application based on packaging type available in pom.xml file.

note: jar or war file will be created in target folder.

-> install goal is used to execute unit test code of our application (junit code)
-> package goal is used to generate jar or war file for our application based on pacaging type available in pom.xml file.

note: jar or war file will be created in target folder

-> install goal is used to install our project as a dependency in maven local repository.

note: every maven goal is associated with maven plugin. when we execute maven goal then respective maven plugin will execute to perform the operation.

syntax : mvn <goal-name>

note : we need to execute maven goals from project folder

creating web application using maven
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
>> mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp -DgroupId=in.ashokit -DartifactId=01-maven-web-app -DinteractiveMode=false

source code repository tools (or) version control software
----------------------------------------------------------
-> multiple developers will work for project development
-> developers will be working from multiple locations
-> all developers code should be sotre at one place (code integration should happen)
-> to integrate all the developers source code at one place we will use surcecode repository softwares

advantages with source code repository softwares
------------------------------------------------
1. all the developers can connect to repository server and can integrate the code
2. repository server will provide monitored access
	- who
	- when
	- why
	- what

repository tools
----------------
svn (outdated)
git hub
bitbucket

environment setup to work with git hub
--------------------------------------
1. create github account (www.github.com)
2. download and install git client software (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. once installation completed, right click on the mouse and verify git options display (if git options displaying our git client installation completed successfully)

working with github
-------------------
-> login into github account with your credentials
-> create repository in github
note: repository is used to store project source code. every project will have one repository
-> when we create a repository, unique url will be generated with repository name (i.e. repo url)
-> all the developers will connect to repository using repository url
-> we can create 2 type of repositories in github
	1) public repository
	2) private repository
-> public repository means everybody can access but we can choose who can modify our repository
-> private reporitory means we will choose who can access and who can modify 
	repo url: https://github.com/ashokitshool/01-devops-app.git

working with git bash
---------------------
-> git bash we can use as git client software to perform git operations
-> download and install git client (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-> right click on mouse and choose "open git bash here"

git help : it will display frequently used git commands
git help <cmd-name> : it will open documentation for given command

configure your email and name in git bash with commands
-------------------------------------------------------
$ git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
$ git config --global user.name "name"

$ git init : to initialize our folder as git working tree folder
$ git clone : to clone git repository to our machine froom github.com
	syntax : $ git clone <project-repo-url>
$ git status : it will display staged, un-staged and un-tracked files
	syntax : $ git status
	stages files : the files which are added for commit
	un-staged files : the files which are modified but not added for commit.
	un-tracked files : newly created files
note: to commit a file(s), we should add to staging area first
$ git add : it is used to add file(s) to staging area
	syntax : $ git add <file-name>
		   $ git add .
$ git commit : it is used to commit staged files to git local repository
	syntax : $ git commit -m "reason for commit"
$ git push : to push changes from git local repository to git central repository
	syntax : $ git push

steps to push code to github central repository
-----------------------------------------------
1) create one public repository in git hub (take github repo url)
2) clone github repository using 'git clone' command
	$ git clone 'repo-url'
3) nevigate to repository folder
	$ cd <project-name>
4) create one file in repository folder
	$ touch demo.java
5) check status of the file using 'git status' command
	$ git status (it will display as untracked file)
6) add file to staging area using 'git add' command
	$ git add .
7) commit file to git local repository
	$ git commit -m "commit-msg"
8) push file from git local reposiroty to git central repository using "git push" command
	$ git push
note: if you are doing 'git push' for first time it will ask to enter your github account password

-------------------------------------------------
note: git bash will ask our password only for first time. it will save our git credentials in credential manager in windows machine.
-> go to credential manager -> windows credentials -> select github -> we can modify and delete saved credentials from here
-------------------------------------------------

-> when we do git commit then it will generate a commit-id with 40 characters length
-> from this commit-id it will display first 7 characters in git hub central repository
-> we can check commit history using 'git log' command
-------------------------------------------------
steps to commit maven project to github repository
-------------------------------------------------
1) create maven project
2) create github repository
note: after creating git repository, it will display set of commands to execute
3) open gitbash from project folder and execute below commands

$ git init
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'commit-msg'
$ git branch -M main
$ git remote add origin <repo-url>
$ git push -u origin master
--------------------------------------------------
what we learned so far 

git help
git config
git init
git status
git add .
git restore
git commit -m 'msg'
git push
git clone
git log
git remote add
--------------------------------------------------

when we are working on one task suddenly we may get some other priority task.

usecase
-------
-> manager assigned task id : 101
-> i am working on that task (i am in middle of the task)
-> manager told that stop the work for 101 and complete 102 on prioriy.
-> once 102 is completed then resume your own work on 101

-> when manager asked me to start 102 task, i have already done few changes for 101
(partially completed)

-> we can't push partial changes to repository because with our partial changes existing functionality may break.

-> we can't delete our changes because we have spent few hours of time to implement those changes

--------------------------------
in this scenario we will got for 'git stash' option
--------------------------------

-> git stash is used to save working tree changes to temporary location and make working tree clean
-> after priority work completed we can get stashed changes back using 'git stash apply'

--------------------------------------------
Git Branches
--------------------------------------------
-> branches are used to maintain separate code bases for our project
-> in git repository we can create multiple branches
main
develop
qa
release
research

-> development team will integrate the code in 'develop' branch
-> bug-fixing team will integrate the code in 'qa' branch
-> R & D team will integrate the code in 'research' branch

-> in github we can create branches
-> to clone particular branch in git repo we will use below command
	$ git clone -b <branch-name> <repo-url>
---------------------------------------------------------
what is git branch?
why we need git branches?
how to create git branches?
how to clone particular branch?
how to switch from one branch to another branch?
----------------------------------------------------------

Branch Merging
--------------------------------------------------------
-> the process of merging changes from one branch to another branch is called as Branch merging

steps to do branch merging
--------------------------
1) create feature branch from main branch
2) clone feature branch
3) create new file in feature branch then commit and push to central repo
4) go to central repository then create pull request to merge feature branch changes to main branch

note: once feature branch changes are merged to main branch then we can delete feature branch (if required)

-----------------------------------------------------
what is .gitignore ? 
-----------------------------------------------------
-> this .gitignore is used to configure the files or folders which we want to ignore from our commits
-> the files and folders which are not required to commit to central repository those things we can configure in .gitignore file

ex. in maven project 'target' folder will be available which is not required to commit to central repository. this we can configure in .gitignore file.

git merge vs git rebase
--------------------------------------------------------------------
-> these commands are used to merge changes from one branch to another branch
-> git merge will maintain commit history
-> git rebase will not maintain that commit history
-> when we are working on particular sprint and we want to merge changes from one branch to another branch then we will use 'git merge' command
-> once sprint-1 is delivered then we want to take latest code of sprint-1 to start sprint-2 development. in this scenario we don't need commit history so we will use 'git rebase' command.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
what is git pull command
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> pull command is used to take latest changes from repository to local 
-> when we want to make some changes to code, it is always recommended to take git pull

note: when we execute 'git pull' there is a chance of getting conflicts. we need to resolve the conflicts and we should push the code without conflicts.

Apache Tomcat Server#
#####################
-> apache tomcat is a web server
-> apache tomcat is used to run java web applications
-> apache tomcat is free & open source
-> apache tomcat runs on 8080 port by default (we can change that port)

Apache tomcat folder structure
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
bin : it contains commands to start and stop tomcat server
conf : it contains configuration files
lib : it contains libraries (jar files)
logs : it contains server log files
temp : temp files will be created here (we can delete them)
webapps: this is called as deployment folder
note : we will keep war file in webapps folder for deployment

working with apache tomcat in linux
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> login into aws management console
-> create ec2 instance (amazon linux ami)
-> connect to ec2 instance using mobaextrm / putty
-> install java software using below commands
	$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
-> verify the version of jave installed in our machine
	$ java -version
note: if we have multiple java versions installed then we can switch to particular version using below command
	$ alternatives --config java
-> we can download apache tomcat from official website
	url : "https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.65/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.65.tar.gz"
-> we can find apache tomcat urls to download in official website downloads page
-> copy the url of tar file and execute below command in linux machine
	$ wget <tomcat-tar-file-url>
note: I am using
	"https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.65/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.65.tar.gz"
-> after tomcat tar file got downloaded then extract tomcat tar file using below command
	$ tar -xvf <tomcat-tar-file-name>
-> go inside tomcat folder and see folder structure
	$ cd tomcat-folder
	$ ls -ltr
-> go to tomcat bin directory and run tomcat server
	$ cd bin
	$ ./startup.sh
note: tomcat server runs on 8080 port by default. enable this port in security group as custom TCP 
type : custom TCP
protocol : TCP
port range : 8080
source : custom (0.0.0.0/0)
-> access tomcat server from your browser
	URL : http://ec2-vm-public-ip:8080/
note: it should open tomcat server home page
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> by default the host manager is only accessible from a browser running on the same machine as tomcat. if you want to modify this restriction, you'll need to edit the Host manager's context.xml file.

-> file location: <tomcat>/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
-> in manager context.xml file, change <valve>section like below  (allow attribute value changed)
<context antiresourceLocking="false" priviledged="true">
<valve classname="org.apache.catalina.valves.remoteaddrvalve" allow".*" />
</context>

add tomcat users in 'tomcat-folder/conf/tomcat-users.xml" file like below
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> stop the tomcat server and start it
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
we can change tomcat server default port in tomcat/conf/server.xml file
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> when we change tomcat port number in server.xml file then we have to enable that port in security group which is associated with our ec2 instance

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
steps to display maven web application in tomcat server
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) create maven web application
2) edit "index.jsp" file like below (file location : project-folder\src\main\webapp)

<html>
<body>
<h2><font color="red"> welcome to ashok it..!!</font></h1>
<h2>Learn here.. Lead anywhere..!!</h2>

<a href="https://ashokitech.com/online-training-schedules">Click Here To See Training Schedules</a>
</body>
</html>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) package maven web application as war file using maven goals
	$ mvn clean package
4) go to tomcat server admin dashboard and click on "manager app"
5) select war file to upload and click on 'deploy" button
6) war file will be deployed and it will display in applications
7) click on application path (it will open the application in browser)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

conclusion
++++++++++
-> stop apache tomcat server
-> stop ec2 instance
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jenkins#
########

what is jenkins?
-> jenkins is an open source automation tool for CI and CD
-> jenkins tool developed using java
-> jenkins is part of hudson project
-> initially it is called as hudson then later it renamed to jenkins

About CI CD
+++++++++++
-> CI and CD are two most frequently used terms in modern development practices and devops practices.
-> CI stands for Contineous Integration. it is fundamental devops best practice where developers frequently merge code changes to central repository where automated builds and test runs.
-> CD means contineous delivery or contineous deployment
-> jenkins is a self-contained, open-source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivery or deploying software.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
build and deployment process
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) take latest source code from repository --> git
2) compile source code --> maven
3) execute unit tests (Junits) --> apache,selenium
4) perform code review --> sonar qube
5) package code as war file --> maven
6) deploy the war file into server --> tomcat

note : all the above build and deployment tasks can be automated using jenkins tool

components of jenkins :
+++++++++++++++++++++++
master node : the system where you install and run jenkins
managed node : target systems managed by jenkins
repository : version controlled system where you keep your code.
UI : user interface to manage and configure jenkins.
Pipeline : means of contineous deployment of your code to target systems from the version control system.
plugins : means of enhancing the functionality of a jenkins.

jenkins installation : 
++++++++++++++++++++++
prerequisite : 
	one ec2 amazon linux 2 instance with internet access 
	java 8 runtime environments

step 1
------
jenkins installation on aws ec2
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
create an ec2 instance with amazon linux 2 ami
amazon linux 2 ami (HVM), SSD volume type
connect to your ec2 instance

#update all packages
	$ sudo yum update -y
#install java
	$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
	$ sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 --> jenkins now runs on java 11 gives error in java 8)
	$ sudo alternatives --config java --> (for setting default jenkins version)

step 2 
------
Jenkins installation on aws ec2 using yum
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
#add jenkins repo to your yum repository
$ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo

#import a key file from jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package
$ sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io.key

#for amazon linux 2
$ sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel

#install jenkins
$ sudo yum install jenkins -y

#start and enable jenkins service
$ sudo systemctl start jenkins
$ sudo systemctl enable jenkins
$ sudo systemctl status jenkins

#get the initial administrative password
$ sudo cat /var/bin/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

pwd : 5fe6ddcc9db244cab6aca5ccf2d6a83a

step 3 :
--------
open your ec2 instance public dns or public ip (http://<public-dns/public-ip>:8080/) along with port 8080 in your favorite browser. and provide the administrative password obtained during the installation.

note: make sure you enabled 8080 port in security group inboud rules which is attached to ec2 instance.
	url : http://43.204.214.21:8080/
-> provide pwd which we have copied to unlock jenkins
-> select 'install suggested plugins' card (it will install those plugins)
-> create admin account

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
creating first job in jenkins
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) goto jenkins dashboard
2) click on new item
	-> enter item name (job name)
	-> select free style project & click ok
	-> enter some description
	-> click on 'build tab'
	-> click on 'add build step' and select 'execute shell'
3) enter below shellscript
echo "Hello Guys,"
touch ashokit.txt
echo "Hello Guys, Welcome to Jenkins Classes" >> ashokit.txt
echo "Done..!!"
4) apply and save
note: with above steps we have created jenkins job
5) click on 'build now' to start job execution
6) click on 'build number' and then click on 'console output' to see job execution details.

-> jenkc2 : /ins Home Directory in Evar/lib/jenkins/workspace

4) run the job now using 'build now' option and see 'conole output' of job
5) once job executed successfully, go to tomcat server dashboard and see application should be displayed
6) click on the application name (it should display our application)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
jenkins pipeline
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> sequence of jobs execution is called as pipeline
-> for our application, we will have multiple environments like below
	-> dev -- development environment
	-> sit -- system integration testing
	-> uat -- user integration testing
	-> pilot -- prepod environment
	-> prod -- final environment
-> for every environment, one jenkins job will be created
	jenkins-dev-job -> dev environment (dev server)
	jenkins-sit-job -> sit environment (sit server)
	jenkins-uat-job -> uat environment (uat server)
	jenkins-pilot-job -> pilot environment (pilot server)
	jenkins-prod-job -> prod environment (prod server)
-> if we want to deploy code changes to all environments then it is recommended to create build pipeline
-> by using build pipeline we can execute jenkins jobs sequentially

requirement
+++++++++++
-> if code commit happened in git hub then deploy code into dev server
-> if dev server deployment successful, then deploy code into sit environment
-> if sit server deployment successful, then deploy code into uat environment

steps to create jenkins pipeline
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) create ec2 vm and install tomcat server (dev server vm)
2) create ec2 vm and install tomcat server (sit server vm)
3) create ec2 vm and install tomcat server (uat server vm)
4) create ec2 vm and install jenkns (jenkins server vm)
5) install jdk, maven, git,deploy to container in jenkins server vm
6) build pipeline plugin
7) create jobs in pipeline server
	dev-job -> dev server
	sit-job -> sit server (sit job should execute if dev-job is stable)
	uat-job -> uat server (uat job should execute if sit-job is stable)
8) create jenkins build pipeline to execute jobs in sequence
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** if we forgot jenkins passowrd, then how to recover it ? ***
-> go to /var/lib/jenkins/
	open : config.xml file
-> set value for useSecurity as false
	ex : <useSecurity>false</useSecurity>
-> re-start jenkins and try to access

*********** how to change jenkins port number ************
-> go to root directory
-> go to /etc/sysconfig
-> open jenkins file and change jenkins port number
-> restart jenkins server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
how to create jenkins jobs with build parameters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> create new item 
-> enter item name & select free style project
-> select 'this project is parameterized' in general section
-> select choice parameter
-> name : branch name
-> choices :  enter every branch name in nextline
-> branches to build : */${branch name}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
creating users in jenkins
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> manage jenkins -> manage users
-> create user
note: 2 developer users and 2 devops users
-> go to /var/lib/jenkins/users
-> view users.xml file (you can see user accounts created)
-> configure global security for users

exercise
++++++++
-> create 1 account for devops team member
-> create 1 account for development team member

-> configure roles for devops team member and developmemt team member
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
jenkins master and slave configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when we build the jenkins job in a single jenkins master node then jenkins uses the resource of the base machine and if no executor is available then the jobs are qued in jenkins server.

sometimes you might need several different environments to test your builds. this cannot be done by a single jenkins server.

it is recommended not to run different jobs in the same system that required a different environment.
in such scenarios where we need a different machine with a different environment that takes the specific job from the master to build

on the same jenkins setup, multiple teams are working with their jobs. all jobs are running on the same base operating system and the base operating system has limited resources.

to overcome this problem, jenkins provided distributed architecture i.e. jenkins master slave architecture

jenkins uses a master-slave architecture to manage distributed builds. the machine where we install jenkins software will be jenkins master and that runs on port 8080 by default. on the slave machine, we install a program callled agent. this agent requires jvm. this agent executes the task provided by jenkins master. we can launch n numbers of agents and we can configure which task will be run on which agent server from jenkins master by assigning the agent to the task.

jenkins master
++++++++++++++
your main jenkins server is the master. the master's job is to handle:
a) scheduling build jobs.
b) dispatching builds to the slaves for the actual execution.
c) monitor the slaves (possibly taking them online and offline as required).
d) recording and presenting the build results.
e) a master instance of jenkis can also execute build jobs directly

jenkins slave
+++++++++++++
a slave is a java executable that runs on a remote machine. following are the characteristics of jenkins slaves.
1) it hears requests from the jenkins master instance.
2) slaves can run on a variety of operating systems.
3) the job of a slave is to do as they are told to, wich involves executing build jobs dispatched by the master.
4) you can configure a project to always run on a particular slave machine or a particular type of slave machine, or simply let jenkins pick the next available slave.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
working with jenkins master slave architecture
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
step1: create jenkins master
----------------------------
1) create ec2 instance
2) connect ec2 using mobaxterm
3) install git client
4) install git java software
5) install jenkins server
6) add git, jdk and maven plugins
7) enable jenkins port number in security group
8) access jenkins server in browser and login

step2: create jenkins slave
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) create ec2 instance
2) connect to ec2 using mobaxterm
3) install git client
4) install java software
5) create one directory in /home/ec2-user (ex: slavenode)

step3: configure slave node in jenkins master node
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) go to jenkins dashboard
2) go to manage jenkins
3) go to manage nodes & clouds
4) click on 'new node' -> enter node name -> select permanent agent
5) enter remote root directory (/home/ec2-user/slavenode)
6) enter label name as slave-1
7) select launch method as 'launch agent via ssh'
8) give host as 'slave vm dns url'
9) add credentials (select kind as : ssh username with private key)
10) enter username as : ex2-user
11) select private key as enter directly and add private key

note: open gitash from your .pem file location and execute below command to get private key from pem file
	$ cat <key-pair-file-name>.pem
note: it will display private key on git bash terminal (just copy and paste in jenkins)
12) select host key strategy as 'manually trusted key verification strategy'
13) click on apply and save (we can see configure slave)

**************with above steps master and slave configuration completed************************
-> go to jenkins server and create jenkins job
note: uder generation section of job creation process, select 'restrict where this project can run'
and enter slave node1 label name and finish job creation

-> execute the job using 'build now' option
note: job will be executed on slave node (go to job console output and verify execution details)

++++++++++++++++++++++
jenkins - pipeline
++++++++++++++++++++++
jenkins piepline is an automation solution that lets you create simple or complex pipelines.
jenkins pipeline is a combination of plugins which automates number of tasks and makes the ci/cd pipeline efficient, high in quality and reliable.
jenkins provides two ways of developing a pipeline
1) scripted
2) declarative
traditionally, jenkins jobs were created using jenkins ui called freestyle jobs.
in jenkins 2.0, jenkins introduced a new way to create jobs using the technique called pipeline as code.

in pipeline as code technique, jobs are created using a script file that contains the steps to be executed by the job. -> git + maven +tomcat + sonarqube

in jenkins, that scripted file is called as jenkins file

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
what is jenkinsfile?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

jenkinsfile is nothing but a simple text file which is used to write the jenkins pipeline and to automate the continuous integration process

jenkinsfile usually checked in along with the project's source code in git repo. ideally, every application will have its own jenkinsfile.

jenkinsfile can be written in two ways - 

1) scripted pipeline syntax
2) declarative pipeline syntax

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
what is jenkins scripted pipeline?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

jenkins pipeline are traditionally written as scripted pipeline. ideally, the scripted pipeline is stored in jenkins webUI as a jenkins file. the end-to-end scripted pipeline script is written in groovy.

it requires knowledge of groovy programming as a prerequisite
jenkinsfile starts with the word node
can contain standard programming constructs like if-else block, try-catch block, etc.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
sample scripted pipeline
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
node {
	stage('Stage 1'){
		echo 'hello'
        }
}

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
what is jenkins declarative pipeline?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

the declarative pipeline subsystem in jenkins pipeline is relatively new, and provides a simplified, opinionated syntax on top of the pipeline subline subsystems.

the latest addition in jenkins pipeline job creation technique

jenkins declarative pipeline needs to use the predefined constructs to create pipelines. hence, it is not flexible as a scripted pipeline.

jenkinsfile starts with the word pipeline.

jenkins declarative pipeline should be the preferred way to create a jenkins job as they offer a rich set of features, come with less learning curve & no prerequisite to learn programming language like groovy just for the sake of writing pipeline code.

we can also validate the syntax of the declarative pipeline code before running the job. it helps to avoid lot of runtime issues with the build script.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
our first declarative pipeline
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
pipeline{
  agent any
    stages{
      stage('Welcome Step'){
        steps{
          echo 'welcome to jenkins scripting'
        }
      }
    }
}

pipeline : entire declarative pipeline script should be written inside the pipeline block. it's a mandatory block.

agent : specify where the jenkins build job should run. agent can be at pipeline level or stage level. it's mandatory to define an agent.

stages : stages block constitutes different executable stage blocks. at least one stage block is mandatory inside stages block

stage : stage block contains the acutal execution steps. stage block has to be defined within stages block. it's mandatory to have at least one stage block inside the stages block. also its mandatory to name each stage block & this name will be shown in  the stage view after we run the job.

steps : steps block contains the acutal build step. it's mandatory to have at least one step block inside a stage block.

depending on the agent's operating system (where jenkins job runs), we can use shell, bat, etc. inside the steps command.

Sonar Qube
++++++++++
-> sonar qube is contineous code quality checking tool
-> we can do code review using sonar qube tool

what is code coverage & code review
-----------------------------------
code coverage: how many lines of source code is tested by unit test cases
note: industry standard code coverage is 80%
code review: checking coding conventions

-> sonar qube is an open source software quality management tool
-> it will contineously analyse and measure quality of the source code
-> it will generate code review report in html format / pdf format
-> it is a web based tool and it supports 29 programming languages
-> it will support muli os platform
-> it will support multiple databases (mysql, oracle, sql server, postgre sql...)
-> it supports multiple browsers
-> sonar qube will identify below category of issues in project source code

1) duplicate code
2) coding standards
3) unit tests
4) code coverage
5) complex code
6) potential bugs

-> initially sonar qube was developed only for java projects
-> today sonar qube is supporting for 29 languages

open source: java, java script, c#, web technologies (html, jsp), xml, python, groovy, php, puppet 

commercial: abap, c, c++, cobol, pl/sql, visual basic, vb.net, swift etc...

environment setup
+++++++++++++++++
-> java is the pre-requesite software
7.6 --> java 1.8v
7.8 - 8.x --> java 11v
note: we can check this compatability in official sonar website

hardware requirements
+++++++++++++++++++++
minimum ram: 2 GB

t2.micro --> 1 gb ram
t2.medium --> 4 gb ram

sonar qube architecture
+++++++++++++++++++++++
1) sonarqube scanner
(it will take source code as input and it will generate report)

2) sonarqube server
-> sonarqube server contains 3 components
 1) compute engine
 2) database
 3) webserver
 4) search engine
          - compute engine 
                           - vulnerabilities
                           - bugs
                           - code smells
note: compute engine will store report into h2 db (we can configure external db also)
	- webserver (it will display report in webserver)
note: developers will see sonar report and will fix the issues
	- search engine (it will give search results)

-> create ec2 instance with 4gb ram (t2.medium)
-> connect with ec2 instance
-> check space (free -h)

$ sudo su
$ yum install wget -y
$ cd /opt
$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk 
$ java -version
$ yum install wget unzip -y
$ wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-7.8.zip
$ unzip sonarqube-7.8.zip

note: sonarqube server will not run with root user

-> create new user
$ useradd sonar
$ visudo

-> configure sudo user without pwd
sonar ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

-> change ownership for sonar folder
$ chown -R  sonar:sonar /opt/sonarqube-7.8/
$ chmod -R 775 /opt/sonarqube-7.8
$ su - sonar (switching to sonar user)

-> go to bin directory then go to linux directory and run sonar server
$ sh sonar.sh start
-> check sonar server status
$ sh sonar.sh status

note: sonar server runs on 9000 port number by default

-> enable port number in ec2 vm - security group
-> access sonar server in browser
	url : http://vm-ip:9000/
-> default credentials of sonar user is admin & admin
-> after login, we can go to security and we can enable force authentication.

note: once your work got completed then stop your ec2 instance because we have t2.medium so bill will be generated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> start sonar server
-> go to sonar server bin folder
-> switch to sonar user
$ sh sonar.sh start

note: search engine can't run with root user

$ sh sonar.sh status

note: if sonar not started, then go to log file and see

$ sudo rm -rf /opt/sonar-folder/temp/
$ cd ../bin/
$ sh sonar.sh start
$ sh sonar.sh status
-> access sonar server in browser and login into that

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
integrate sonar server with java maven app
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> configure sonar properties under <properties/> tag in "pom.xml"

<properties>
<sonar.host.url>http://3.110.114.186:9000/</sonar.host.url>
<sonar.login>admin</sonar.login>
<sonar.password>admin</sonar.password>
</properties>

-> go to project pom.xml file location and execute below goal
	$ mvn sonar:sonar
-> after build success, goto sonar dashboard and verify that

note: instead of username and pwd we can configure sonar token in pom.xml

++++++++++++++++++++++++++
working with sonar token
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> goto sonar -> login -> click on profile -> my account -> security -> generate token
-> copy the token and configure that token in pom.xml file like below

<sonar.host.url>
http://3.110.114.186:9000/</sonar.host.url>
<sonar.login>760ebb6f81398a6ea6949adf4dc2291347377d3e</sonar.login>

-> then build the project using 'mvn sonar:sonar' goal

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> for each language sonar qube provided one quality profile with set of rules

-> quality profile means set of rules to perform code review

-> we can create our own quality profile based on project requirement

-> create one quality profile

	- Name : SBI_Project
	- Language : Java
	- Parent : None

Note: we can make our quality profile as default one then it will be applicable for all the projects which gets reviewed under this sonar server.

note: if we have any common ruleset for all projects then we can create one quality profile and we can use that as parent quality profile for other projects.

-> we can configure quality profile to specific project
	
	-> click on project name
	-> go to administration
	-> click on quality profile
	-> select profile required

------------------------------------------------------------
Quality Gate
------------------------------------------------------------
-> quality gate represents set of metric to identify proje t quality is passed or failed
-> every project quality gate should be passed
-> in sonar we have default quality gate
-> if required, we can create our own quality gate also

note: if project quality gate is failed then we should not accept that code for deployment
------------------------------------------------------------
-> if project is having sonar issues then development team is responsible to fix those issues
-> as a devops engineer, we will perform code review and we will send code review report to development team (we will send sonar server url to development team)

++++++++++++++++++++++++

email notification in jenkins
**************************************************************************
-> we can configure email notification in jenkins
-> with this option we can sent email notification to team members after jenkins job execution completed
-> we need to configure SMTP properties to send emails
-> go to manage jenkins
-> add email extension server
-> we will add company provided SMTP server details

Note: for practice we can use GMAIL SMTP properties

-> once SMTP properties added then we can configure email notification as 'Post Build Action' in jenkins job

Terraform
++++++++++

-> terraform is an open source s/w created by Hashicorp and written in Go programming language
-> terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool,
-> infrastructure as code is the process of managing infrastructure in a file or files rather than manually configuring resources in a user interface (UI)

-> In Terraform resources are nothing but virtual machines, elastic ip, security groups, network interfaces

-> terraform code is written in the hashicorp configuration language (HCL) in files with the exension .tf

-> terraform allows users to use Hashicorp configuration language (HCL) to create the files containing definitions of their desired resources

-> Terraform supports all most all cloud providers (AWS, AZURE, GCP, OpenStack etc..)

-> to automate infrastructure creation we will use terraform.

Terraform vs Cloud Formation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> terraform developed by hashicorp
-> cloudformation developed by aws

-> terraform supports many cloud providers
-> cloud formation will support only in aws

-> terraform uses hashicorp configuration language (HCL)
which build by hashicorp. it is fully compatible with JSON.

-> aws cloud formation utilizes either json or yaml. cloud formation has a limit of 51,000 bytes for the template body itself.

Terraform vs Ansible
++++++++++++++++++++
-> terraform developed by Hashicorp
-> ansible is also an open source software

-> terraform is an infrastructure as a code, which means they are designed to provision the servers themselves.
-> ansible is a configuration management tool. which means ansible designed to install and manage software on existing servers.

-> terraform is ideal for creating, managing, and improving infrastructure.
-> ansible is ideal for software provisioning, application deployment and configuration management.

pre-requisites
++++++++++++++
1) any cloud provider (AWS, azure, gcp, openstack etc..)
2) iam user account (secret key and access key)
3) iam user should have amazonEc2FullAccess


steps:
1) create ec2 instance (redHat linux)
2) connect to ec2 vm using mobaxterm
3) switch to root user
	$ sudo su -
4) install unzip software
	$ yum install wget install unzip vim -y
5) download terraform software
	(https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
$ sudo yum install -y yum-utils
$ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
$ sudo yum -y install terraform

6) check terraform version
$ terrafrm -v
7) create iam user with programmatic access and provide 'AmazonEc2FullAccess'
8) download secret key and access key
9) write terrafom script
$ mkdir terraformscript
$ cd terraformscript
4 vi FirstTFScript.tf

provider 'aws'{
	region='ap-south-1'
	access_key='your-access-key'
	secret_key='your-secret-key'
}

resource 'aws_instance' 'AWSServer'{
	ami='ami-05c8ca4485f8b138a'
	instance_type='t2.micro'
	key_name='linux'
	security_groups=['launch-wizard-1']
	tags={
		Name='Terraform Server'
	}
}

10) initialize terraform using init command
	$ terraform init
11) format your script (indent spaces)
	$ terraform fmt
12) validate your script
	$ terraform validate
13) create execution plan for your script
	$ terraform plan
14) create infrastructure
	$ terraform apply
	$ terraform -auto-aprove
note: when the script got executed it will store that state in a file. if we execute script again it will not create. if you delete that state file and execute script again then it will create it.
15) destroy infrastructure
	$ terraform destroy -auto-aprove
-> in first script we kept provider and resources info in single script file. we can keep provider and resources information in separate files.

Ex : provider.tf & main.tf


#Script to create multiple Ec2 instances

provider 'aws'{
	region='ap-south-1'
	access_key='your-access-key'
	secret_key='your-secret-key'
}

resource 'aws_instance' 'AWSVM_Server'{
	count='3'
	ami='ami-05c8ca4485f8b138a'
	instance_type='t2.micro'
	key_name='linux'
	security_groups=['ashokit_security_group']
	tags={
		Name='REDHAT-EC2-VM1'
	}
}


Note: once it is created, then destroy infrastructure using below command
$ terraform destroy -auto-aprove

variables in typescript
+++++++++++++++++++++++
-> we can maintain variables in separate file
$ vi vars.tf

variable 'ami'{
	description='Amazon Machine Image Value'
	default='ami-05c8ca4485f8b138a'
}

variable 'instance_type'{
	description='Amazon Instance Type'
	default='t2.micro'
}

variable 'instance_count'{
	description='Total No. of Instances'
	default='2'
}

create main.tf file using variables
$ vi main.tf
provider 'aws'{
	region='ap-south-1'
	access_key='AKIA4GJG'
	secret_key='d04co9pmnE5xNj8xiubpUPhI'
}

resource 'aws_instance' 'AWSServer'{
	count'${var.instances_count}'
	ami='${var.ami}'
	instance_type='${var.instance_type}'
	key_name='linux'
	security_groups=['launch-wizard-1']
	tags={
		Name='EC2 VM - ${count.index}'
	}
}

note: we can supply variables in runtime also
-> remove instances_count variable from var.tf file and pass like below
$ terraform apply -var instances_count='2' -auto-aprove

Comments in Terraform Script
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# - single line comment
// - single line comment (java style)
/* and */ multi line comments

Dealing with secret key and access key
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> we have configure secret_key and access_key in terraform script file. instead of that we can configure them as environment variables.

$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='AKIA4MGQ5UW7B'
$ export 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='kzpje2T8s1lHsywFLTOI89XU7sRy8'

-> to verify environment variables we can use echo command
$ echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
$ echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

-> now remove credentials from terraform script and execute it.

note: we are setting provider credentials in terminal so these variables will be available for current session. if we want to set permanently add them in .bashrc file

working with user data
++++++++++++++++++++++

-> it is used to execute script when instance launched for first time.
-> create userdata in one file
$ vi installHttpd.sh
#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><h1>welcome to ashok it..!</h1></html>" > index.html
service httpd start

$ chmod u+x installHttpd.sh
-> create main script in main.tf file
-> vi main.tf

provider 'aws'{
	region='ap-south-1'
	access_key='your-access-key'
	secret_key='your-secret-key'
}

resource 'aws_instance' 'AWSServer'{
	ami='ami-05c8ca4485f8b138a'
	instance_type='t2.micro'
	key_name='linux'
	security_groups=['ashokit_security_group']
	user_data='${file("installHttpd.sh")}'
	tags={
		Name='Terraform Server'
	}
}

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
creating s3 bucket using terraform script
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> add s3 policy for iam user
-> execute below terraform script to create s3 bucket in aws 

provider 'aws'{
	region='ap-south-1'
	access_key='your_access_key'
	secret_key='your_secret_key'
}

resource 'aws_s3_bucket' 's3bucketashokit'{

bucket='s3bucketashokit'
acl='private'

versionining{
	enabled=true
	}

tags={
	Name='S3 Bucket By Ashok'
	}
}

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
create mysql db in aws using terraform
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> provider RDS access for IAM user
-> execute below script to create mysql db in aws cloud

provider 'aws'{
	region='ap-south-1'
	access_key='your-access-key'
	secret_key='your-secret-key'
}

resource 'aws_db_instance" 'default'{
	allocated_storage= 100
	engine='mysql'
	engine_version='5.7'
	instance_class='db.t3.micro'
	name='mydb'
	username='foo'
	password='foobarbaz'
	parameter_group_name='default.mysql5.7'
	skip_final_snapshot=true

Ansible Tutorial
+++++++++++++++++++

1) what is ansible
2) configuration management
3) push based vs pull based
4) how to install ansible
5) host inventory
6) ansible modules
7) yaml
8) playbooks
9) hands on
10) conclusion

configuration management
++++++++++++++++++++++++
it is a method through which we automate admin tasks. configuration management tool turns your code into infrastructure.
so your code would be testable, repeatable and versionable.

Infrastructure refers to the composite of -

software
network
people
process

+++++++++++++
Ansible
+++++++++++++
-> ansible is one among the devops configuration management tools which is famous for its simplicity
-> it is an opensource software developed by michael dehaan and its ownership is on redhat
-> ansible is an open source IT configuration management, deployment & orchestration tool.
-> this tool is very simple to use yet powerful enough to automate complex multi-tier IT application environments.
-> ansible is an automation tool that provides a way to define infrastructure as code.
-> infrastructure as code (IAC) simply means that managing infrastructure by writing code rather that using manual processes.
-> the best part is that you don't even need to know the commands used to accomplish a perticular task.
-> you just need to specify what state you want the system to be in and ansible will take care of it.
-> the main components of ansible are playbooks, configuration management and deployment.
-> ansible uses playbooks to automate deploy, manage, build, test and configure anything.
-> ansible was written in python.

+++++++++++++++++++++
Ansible Features
+++++++++++++++++++++
-> Ansible manages machines in an agent-less manner using SSH
-> Built on top of python and hence provides a lot of python's functionality
-> YAML based playbooks
-> uses SSH for secure connections
-> follows push based architecture for sending configuration related notifications
-> follows push based architecture for sending configuration related notifications

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
push based vs pull based
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> tools like puppet and chef are pull based
-> agents on the server periodically checks for the configuration information from central server (master)
-> ansible is push based
-> central server pushes the configuration information on target servers.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++
how ansible works?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out a small program called ansible modules to them.

then ansible executed these modules and removed them after finished. the library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no daemons, servers, or databases required.

the management node is the controlling node that controls the entire execution of the playbook.

the inventory file provides the list of hosts where the Ansible modules need to be run.

The management node makes an SSH connection and executes the small modules on the host's machine and install the software.

Ansible removes the modules once those are installed so expertly.

It connects to the host machine executes the instructions, and if it is successfully installed, then remove that code in which one was copied on the host machine.

ansible basically consists of three components

ansible requires the following components in order to automate network infrastructure.

1) controlling nodes
2) managed node
3) ansible playbook

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
controlling nodes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
are usually linux bastion servers that are used to access the switches/routers and other network devices.
these network devices are referred to as the managed nodes.

+++++++++++++++++++
managed nodes
+++++++++++++++++++
managed nodes are stored in the hosts file for ansible automation

++++++++++++++++++++++
Ansible Playbook
++++++++++++++++++++++
Ansible Playbooks are expressed in YAML format and serve as the repository for the various tasks that will be executed on the managed nodes (hosts).

Playbooks are a collection of tasks that will be run on one or more hosts.

++++++++++++++++++++++
Inventory file
++++++++++++++++++++++
Ansible's inventory hosts file is used to list and group your servers.

its default location is /etc/ansible/hosts

Note: In inventory file we can mention IP address or hostname also

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
few important points about inventory file
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> comments begins with '#' character
-> blank lines are ignore
-> groups of hosts are delimited by '[header]' elements
-> you can enter hostnames or ip addresses
-> a hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups
-> ungrouped hosts are specifying before any group headers like below

Ansible's inventory hosts file is used to list and group your servers. Its default location is /etc/ansible/hosts

Note: In inventory file we can mention IP address or hostname also

Sample Inventory file
++++++++++++++++++++++
# Blank lines are ignore

# Ungrouped hosts are specifying before any group headers like below

192.168.122.1
192.168.122.2
192.168.122.3

[webservers]
192.168.122.1
#192.168.122.2
192.168.122.3

[dbserver]
192.168.122.1
192.168.122.2
ashokit-db1.com
ashokit-db2.com

++++++++++++++++++
Ansible setup
++++++++++++++++++
=> create 2 redhat systems in aws (free tier eligible)
1 - ansible system
1 - host system

=> connect to all the systems and create ansible user 

$ sudo useradd ansible
$ sudo passwd ansible

$ pwd
  confirm pwd:

$ sudo visudo 
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

$ sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

-> comment PasswordAuthentication no
-> un-comment PasswordAuthentication yes

-> restart the server

$ sudo service sshd restart

note: do the above steps in all the 2 machines

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
install ansible in control node
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> switch to ansible user

$ sudo su ansible

-> install python

$ sudo yum install python3 -y

-> check python version

$ python --version (it will fail bcz we used python3)
$ python3 --version

-> update python alternatives

$ sudo alternatives --set python /usr/bin/python3

-> check python version

$ python --version

-> install pip (it is a python package manager)

$ sudo yum -y install python3-pip

-> install ansible using python pip

$ pip3 install ansible --user

-> verify ansible version

$ ansible --version

-> create ansible folder under /etc

$ sudo mkdir /etc/ansible

-> create ansible.cfg file under /etc/ansible and paste complete content from below git link.

open:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/ansible.cfg

copy the content and paste it in ansible.cfg file with below command

$ sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

-> create hosts file under /etc/ansible.cfg sample content can found in below git link

open : 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/hosts

copy the content and paste it in hosts file with below command

$ sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

************************************************************
with this ansible setup completed
************************************************************

1) update host inventory in ansible server to add host servers details to test connection

$ sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts

$ connect using the username and password
HOST-NODE-IP ansible_user=ansible ansible_password=password

2) use ping module to test ansible and after successful run you can see the below output.

$ ansible all -m ping

note: install sshpass in ansible server if you get below error

'to use the 'ssh' connection type with passwords, you must install the sshpass program

$ sudo yum install sshpass

$ ansible all -m ping

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
generate ssh key in control node and copy ssh key into host node
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) now generate ssh key in ansible server (control node):

$ sudo su ansible
$ ssh-keygen

2) copy it to host servers as ansible user:

$ ssh-copy-id ansible@<Host-Private-IP>

EX: $ ssh-copy-id ansible@172.31.43.23

note: repeat below command by updating host ip for all the host servers.

3) update host inventory in ansible server to add host servers details.

# vi /etc/ansible/hosts

# connect using username and password
# 192.168.1.105 ansible_user=ansible
ansible_password=password

# connect using username and pem(make sure have pem file at given path)

# 172.31.35.23 ansible_user=ec2-user
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/aws.pem

# if ssh keys are copied
172.31.43.23

4) use ping module to test ansible and after successful run you can see the below output.

$ ansible all -m ping
