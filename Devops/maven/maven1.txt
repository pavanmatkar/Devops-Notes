-> Java is a programming language

-> Java language developed by sun microsystem company

-> Oracle company acquired Sun Microsystem 

-> Java is under license of Oracle company

-> Java is a high level programming language

-> Java is simple programming language

-> Java program files will have .java as extension

	Ex: Demo.java, Hello.java, Driver.java, Calculator.java etc..

-> We can't execute .java files directley

-> Java Programs should be converted into Machine understandable format to execute

-> Java Programs (.java file) contains source code

-> We need to compile java source code into byte code using java compiler (javac)

			Ex: javac Demo.java

-> When we compile java code it will create .class file

-> We need to execute .class file to run the java program

			Ex: java Demo

-> When we run java program using java command, JVM will start and it will execute java program

			Note: JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine

-> JVM will convert byte code into machine understandable code

-> Java project contains several java programs (.java files)

-> We need to compile project source code into byte code

-> When we compile project source code we will get .class files

-> To deploy java project, we will package all .class files as JAR or WAR file

			JAR : Java Archieve
			WAR : Web Archieve

-> Standalone java projects will be packaged as JAR file

-> Web Applications will be packaged as WAR file


Maven
+++++

-> Maven is a free and open source software given by Apache Organization

-> Maven s/w is developed using Java programming language

-> Maven is used to perform Build Automation for java projects

-> Maven is called as Java Build Tool


What we can do using maven
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) We can create initial project folder structure using maven

2) We can download "project dependencies" using maven
    (ex : springboot, hibernate, kafka, redis, email, log4j, junit, security...)

-> To develop one java project we will use several frameworks like spring, hibernate etc along with Java

-> We need to download those frameworks and we should  add to our java project

-> These frameworks we are using in our project are called as our project dependencies

-> Instead of we are downloading dependencies, we can tell to maven s/w to download dependencies

Note: Required dependencies we will add in "pom.xml" file then maven s/w will download them

-> pom stands for project object model

-> When we create maven project then pom.xml file will be created automatically

-> pom.xml will act as input file for maven software

3) We can compile project source code using maven

4) We can package java project as jar or war file using maven


Maven Installation
++++++++++++++++++

1) Download and install Java software

-> When we install java we will below 2 things

		a) JDK (Java Development Kit) 

		b) JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

-> JDK contains set of tools to develop java programs

-> JRE contains platform/environment which is used to run java programs

Link To Download Java : https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html

2) Set JAVA_HOME in Environment Variables (System Env Variables)

			User Environment Variables: Specific to particular account which logged in our PC

			System Envrionment Variables : For All Accounts

Note: Environment Variables will be used by operating system

			JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202

3) Set Path for JAVA (Go to System Env Variables -> Env Variables -> System Variables -> Select Path and Click on Edit then add JDK path)

			Path = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202\bin

4) Verify Java installation by executing below command in "Command Promot"

			> java -version

Note: It should dipslay java version which we have installed

5) Download Maven software from Apache website

		Link To download Maven : https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
		File Name : 	apache-maven-3.8.5-bin.zip (Binary Archive)

6) Extract Maven Zip file -> Copy extracted maven folder and paste it in "C" drive

7) Set MAVEN_HOME in System Environment Variables

		MAVEN_HOME = C:\apache-maven-3.8.5

8) Set Path for Maven in System Environment Variables

		Path : C:\apache-maven-3.8.5\bin

9) Open Command Prompt and verify Maven Installaton using below command

		> mvn -version
