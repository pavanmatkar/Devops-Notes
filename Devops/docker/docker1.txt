Application Development
+++++++++++++++++++++

-> Collection of programs is called as software project

-> Software project contains several components

		1) Front end components (User interface logic)

		2) Backend components (Business Logic)

		3) Database Components (Persistence Logic)


-> In order to deploy our application in a machine we need to setup all the Softwares which are required to our application

			Ex: OS, Java 1.8v, MYSQL DB, Tomcat Web Server 9.0v etc.....

-> In Realtime project should be deployed into multiple environments for testing purpose

			Ex : DEV, SIT, UAT, PILOT and PROD


-> DEV env will be used by Developers to perform integration testing

-> SIT env will be used by Testing team to test functionality of the application

-> UAT env will be used by Client to test functionality of the application

-> PILOT env means pre-production testing env

-> PROD means live environment (It is used to deliver the project)


-> To deploy application to these many enivornments we need to take of all the softwars required to run our application in all environments. It is very difficult task.



Virtualization
+++++++++++

-> Installing Multiple Guest Operating Systems in one Host Operating System 

-> Hypervisior S/w will be used to achieve this

-> We need to install all the required softwares in HOST OS to run our application

-> It is old technique to run the applications

-> System performance will become slow in this process

-> To overcome the problems of Virtualization we are going for Containerization concept


Containerization
++++++++++++++

-> It is used to package all the softwares and application code in one container for execution

-> Container will take care of everything which is required to run our application

-> We can run the containers in Multiple Machines easily

-> Docker is a containerization software

-> Using Docker we will create container for our application 

-> Using Docker we will create image for our application

-> Docker images we can share easily to mulitple machines

-> Using Docker image we can create docker container and we can execute it




Conclusion
+++++++++++

-> Docker is a containerization software

-> Docker will take care of application and application dependencies for execution

-> Deployments into multiple environments will become easy if we use Docker containers concept



++++++++Install Docker in Amazon Linux++++++++++++

$ sudo yum update -y
$ sudo yum install docker -y
$ sudo service docker start

# add user to docker group by executing below command
$ sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

$ docker info

#Restart the session
$ exit

Then press 'R' to restart the session (This is in MobaXterm)

++++++++++++++++++++Docker Commands+++++++++++++++++++

#see docker info 
$ docker info

# To see docker images execute below command
$ docker images

# Pulling hello-world docker image 
$ docker pull hello-world

# see docker image 
$ docker images

# Running hello-world docker image 
$ docker run hello-world


###############  Note: Create account in Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/) ###################


Dockerfile 
++++++++++++
Dockerfile is file which contains instructions to create an image. Which contains 
Docker Domain Specific Key Words to build image.
			
		   
DockerImage 
++++++++++++

It's a package which contains everything(Softwares+ENV+Application Code) to run your application.

DockerContainer
+++++++++++++++++++++
Run time instance of an image.If you run docker image container will be created that's where our application(process) is running.

DockerRepo/Registry
++++++++++++++++++++
We can store and share the docker images.

Public Repo 
++++++++++++++
Docker hub is a public reposotiry. Which contains all the open source softwares as 
a docker images. We can think of docker hub as play store for docker images.


Private Repo
+++++++++++++++++++
(Nexus,JFrog,D.T.R(Docker Trusted Registory)),

AWS ECR 
++++++++++++
We can store and share the docker images with in our company network using private repo

Docker Enigine/Daemon/Host 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It's a software or program using which we can create images & contianers.


Docker is cross platform.

Docker CE
   Docker CE will not be supported by Redhat.
   
 
Docker EE
  Docker EE will be support most of the os including redhat.

++++++++++++++++++++
What is docker hub?
+++++++++++++++++++++
It's a public repository for docker images. You can think as play store for
docker images.


-> Create docker file with below content

$ vi Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu
RUN echo "Run One Updated"
RUN echo "RUN TWO"
CMD echo "Echo From Image"
CMD echo "Echo From Latest"
RUN echo "RUN Three"

# Build docker image using docker file
$ docker build -t ashokit-hw .

# Tag Docker image 
$ docker tag ashokit-hw ashokit/ashokit-hw

# Push docker image
$ docker push ashokit/ashokit-hw
