Security Groups
+++++++++++++++

-> AWS providing security for our virtual machines using Security Groups

-> Security Groups will decide who can access our instance/ server / VM & what our Instance can access

-> In Every Security Group we will have 2 types of rules

			1) Inbound Rules

			2) Outbound Rules

-> Inbound rules will decide who can access our instance

-> Outbound rules will decide what our machine can access


Note: To create EC2 instance Security Group is Mandatory.

In General, we will add below Inbound Rules in Security Grous
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For Windows Machines we will use ==> RDP - 3389

For Linux Machines we will use  ==> SSH - 22

For WebServers ==> HTTP - 80

For WebServer + SSL  ==> HTTPS - 443


Note: We can configure particular IP also in security group.

-> If we want to allow all traffic then we will configure "0.0.0.0/0"

Note: AWS Security Groups will help you to configure which traffic we can allow. We can't configure Traffic Deny rules in Security Groups.

      ( Security Groups support for only ALLOW, it doesn't support for DENY )

Note: If we want to configure DENY rules then we should go for NACL concept.

		NACL -> Network Access Control List

Types of IPs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> IP stands for Internet Protocol

-> IP is called as Address of the computer

-> For every computer IP is mandatory to connect with Internet

-> In AWS, we can see 3 types of IPS

		1) Private IP

		2) Public IP

		3) Elastic IP (Static IP)


-> When we launch EC2 instance, AWS will assign one Private IP for our instance (For Internal Purpose)

		Note: We can't connect to EC2 using private ip from outside

-> To connect with EC2 instance from outside we need Public IP. 

-> When we launch EC2 instance, AWS will assign one public IP i.e temporary ip. When we re-start our EC2    instance public ip getting changed.

-> If you want a static ip for your instance then you should go for Elastic IPs.


Note: When we create Elastic IP, we have to associate that Elastic IP with EC2 instance

-> If you keep Elastic IP idle then bill will be generated.

Note: In Free tier, 5 Elastic IPs are free.
