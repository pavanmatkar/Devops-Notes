-> We launched Windows VM using EC2 in AWS

-> We connected with windows vm using RDP client

							RDP
		My Laptop -----------------> Windows VM

-> Windows OS is recommended only for personal use

-> In Realtime Environment , we will use Linux OS to run our applications


Linux
+++++
-> Linux is Free and Open source OS
-> Linux is secured OS
-> Linux is Multi User Based OS
-> Linux Operating System having Several Distributions (flavours)

Ubuntu
Debian
Suse
Fedora
Amazon Linux

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement : Launch Linux VM using EC2 service and connect to Linux VM using Putty or Mobexterm software.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> When we launch EC2 instance use Key-Pair for securing our EC2 instances

-> Key-Pair is a combination of public key & private key

-> AWS will store public key and it will provide private key file for us

		(private key file will have .pem extension)

-> For Windows VM we will open RDP port (3389)

-> For Linux VM we will open SSH port (22)


Launch Linux VM
----------------
Choose AMI (Amazon Linux)
Instance Type -> t2.micro (Free Tier Eligible)
Configure Instance Details (No need to change anything) 
Storage (Default 8gb for Linux)
Add Tag (Name -> MyFirstLinuxVM)
Security Group (SSH with Port 22)
Download Key Pair (.pem file)
Launch Instance
Go to EC2 dashboard and Check Public IP of Ec2 instance and notedown that


Connect to EC2 using putty
--------------------------
1) Download and install putty software
2) Open Putty Gen software and convert .pem to .ppk file
3) Open Putty software and connec to EC2 using IP & PPK file
		(SSH -> Auth -> Upload ppk file)
		IP : <take from ec2 dashboard>
		Username : ec2-user

Connect to EC2 using MobaXterm
-------------------------------
1) Download and install MobaXterm software
2) Open Session and choose SSH
3) Enter HOST name as public ip of Ec2 instance
4) Go to Advanced SSH setting and upload .pem file directley
5) Connect to EC2 and enter username




Deploying web application using EC2 VM
---------------------------------------

-> The applications which we are accessing through internet are called as web applications

-> Web applications are used for Customer 2 Business Communications

		Ex: Google, Gmail, Facebook, Linkedin, Naukri, IRCTC etc.....

-> Web application nothing but collection of web pages

-> Web application will be deployed in webserver

-> Users will send request to webserver to access web application


Steps to host a website in EC2 instance
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1) Login into AWS Cloud Account

2) Launch EC2 Instance ( AMI : Amazon Linux )

3) Connect to EC2 instance using Putty / MobaXterm

4) Install HTTPD Webserver in EC2 instance

5) Setup Website in EC2 instance

6) Configure Security Groups
	(SSH - 22 for admin access & HTTP - 80 for users to access our website)

7) Access Website from Browser using EC2 Instance Public IP


Commands To Execute
-------------------------
$ sudo su
$ yum update -y
$ yum install httpd -y
$ cd /var/www/html
$ echo "Welcome to Ashok IT Website..!!" > index.html
$ service httpd start


Note: After this excersise completed then STOP your EC2 instance.
