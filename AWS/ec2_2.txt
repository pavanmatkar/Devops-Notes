-> We launched Windows VM using EC2 in AWS

-> We connected with windows vm using RDP client

							RDP
		My Laptop -----------------> Windows VM

-> Windows OS is recommended only for personal use

-> In Realtime Environment , we will use Linux OS to run our applications



Linux

-> When we launch EC2 instance use Key-Pair for securing our EC2 instances

-> Key-Pair is a combination of public key & private key

-> AWS will store public key and it will provide private key file for us

		(private key file will have .pem extension)

-> For Windows VM we will open RDP port (3389)

-> For Linux VM we will open SSH port (22)
