Auto Scaling
+++++++++++++

-> In realtime we will perform scale up and scale down for LBR based on our requirement

-> Scale up means increasing resources

-> Scale down means decreasing resources

=> Scaling we can do in 2 ways

	1) Verticle Scaling
	2) Horizontal Scaling

-> Verticle scaling means increasing the power of existing resources

		Ex : chaging from 8 GB RAM to 64 GB RAM

-> Horizontal scaling means increasing no.of machines/servers

		Ex : instead of one machine we will take 4 machines



-> In realtime, we will setup Load Balancer for our applications to handle huge traffic

-> When traffic is increasing we need to increases resources to handle that load

-> When traffic is decreasing we need to decrease resources to reduce cost

What is Auto Scaling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> We can't predict how many users will access our application in a day

-> If we configure 30 servers to run our application, if traffic is huge then 30 servers may not sufficient. If traffic is less then 30 servers not required

-> Adding & removing servers to Load Balancer is time taking process.

		******* To overcome all the above problems, We have Auto Scaling feature in AWS*******

-> The process of adding/removing servers from load balancer based on the traffic is called as Auto Scaling.
